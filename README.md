### Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core Web Applications

**Introduction**

When building web applications, ensuring that only the right users have access to the right resources is crucial. This is where authentication and authorization come into play. In ASP.NET Core, these processes are seamlessly integrated into the framework, providing developers with powerful tools to secure their applications. Let's dive into what these terms mean and how you can implement them in your ASP.NET Core projects.

**Authentication**

Authentication is all about verifying who the user is. Think of it as the digital equivalent of checking someone's ID. In ASP.NET Core, this process is managed by the `IAuthenticationService`, which works with various authentication handlers to perform tasks like logging in users and handling unauthenticated access attempts.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Authentication Schemes**: These are configurations that define how authentication should be performed. Common schemes include cookies, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OAuth.
- **Claims**: These are pieces of information about the user, such as their email or roles, which are used to make authorization decisions.
- **Tokens**: These are used to securely transmit user information between the client and server.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Register Authentication Services**: In your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file, you need to register the authentication services and specify the authentication schemes.
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
       .AddCookie(options => {
           options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
           options.AccessDeniedPath = "/Account/AccessDenied";
       });
   ```

2. **Configure Middleware**: Add the authentication middleware to the request pipeline.
   ```csharp
   var app = builder.Build();
   app.UseAuthentication();
   app.UseAuthorization();
   ```

3. **Create Login and Registration Pages**: Implement the necessary pages and logic for user login and registration, using services like `UserManager` and `SignInManager`.

**Authorization**

Once a user is authenticated, the next step is to determine what they are allowed to do. This is where authorization comes in. Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has access to a resource or can perform a specific action.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Policies**: These are rules that define the requirements for accessing certain resources.
- **Roles**: These are groups of permissions that can be assigned to users.
- **Claims-Based Authorization**: This uses the claims associated with a user to make authorization decisions.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define Policies and Roles**: In your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file, define the authorization policies and roles.
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options => {
       options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
       options.AddPolicy("CanEdit", policy => policy.RequireClaim("EditPermission"));
   });
   ```

2. **Apply Authorization**: Use attributes to apply authorization policies to controllers or actions.
   ```csharp
   [Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]
   public class AdminController : Controller
   {
       // Controller actions
   }
   ```

3. **Handle Access Denied**: Implement logic to handle cases where users are denied access to resources.
   ```csharp
   app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Account/AccessDenied");
   ```

**Real-World Example**

Imagine you're building an online store. You want to ensure that only registered users can place orders, and only administrators can manage product listings. Here's how you might set this up:

1. **User Registration and Login**: You'd create pages where users can sign up and log in. During registration, you'd collect information like email and password, and store this securely using ASP.NET Core Identity.
2. **Role Assignment**: When a user registers, you might assign them a default role of "User". Administrators would have an additional role of "Admin".
3. **Authorization Policies**: You'd define policies to restrict access to certain parts of your application. For example, only users with the "Admin" role can access the product management pages.
